### What others have to say about me:
"_Mashad is a self-starter and enthusiastic person. Not only is he trying new activities all the time, but he also manages to become proficient in them in a short span, Mashad's charismatic personality with his multi-lingual knowledge allows him to adjust to any situation and create an impact. He is always eager to help others and make the ones around him feel comfortable. His background in Mathematics and programming along with his social skills, I believe, will allow him to excel in any setting easily."_  

**- Sathvik Radhakrishnan, studied together with Mashad at UBCO.**
