## About me

Hi! Welcome to my page. My name is Mashad and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student studying at UBCO.

Careerwise, I am currently looking for internships where I can apply my skills but learn new skills at the same time. I believe the best and most efficient way to learn and improve one's own skills is to have hands-on experience working at an internship, because after all, there is only so much we can learn from our courses at university.

At the workplace, I am an experienced individual with a demonstrated history of working in computer software and the healthcare industry. I am proficient in Python, Java, C++, R, MATLAB, and MIPS Assembly Language. I am also well-versed with Salesforce, Tableau, Git, and Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Teams).

On this page, I will outline my technical skills, work experience, and some of my accomplishments. Any inquiries can be addressed to my UBC email on my Resume, or my personal email: mashad.n.chowdhury@gmail.com
