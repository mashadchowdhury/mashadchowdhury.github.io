"_Mashad is a self-starter and enthusiastic person. Not only is he trying new activities all the time, but he also manages to become proficient in them in a short span, Mashad's charismatic personality with his multi-lingual knowledge allows him to adjust to any situation and create an impact. He is always eager to help others and make the ones around him feel comfortable. His background in Mathematics and programming along with his social skills, I believe, will allow him to excel in any setting easily."_

## About me

Hi! Welcome to my page. My name is Mashad and I am a 3rd year **CS** & **Math** student studying at UBCO. Some of my passions and hobbies include **learning languages**, **playing soccer**, **bow hunting**, and (bit of an unusual one!) **learning national anthems** (I know over 30 by heart). In my free time, I practice archery or play soccer with my buddies (if the weather permits!). 

**Careerwise**, I am currently looking for internships where I can apply my skills but learn new skills at the same time. I see every internship as a learning oppurtunity that I can use to improve myself and acquire new skills, where I can apply my knowledge while also learning as I do. I believe the best and most efficient way to learn and improve one's own skills is to have hands-on experience working at an internship, because after all, there is only so much we can learn from our courses at university. That is why I am actively seeking internships which have the right environment for me to prosper and grow.

At the workplace, I am an experienced individual with a demonstrated history of working in computer software and the healthcare industry. I am proficient in Python, Java, R, MATLAB, and MIPS Assembly Language. I am also well-versed with Salesforce, Tableau, Git, and Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Teams).

If you'd like to learn more about me and see more of my work, you can check out my [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_imT3eyv2QNsfHjitBHcew) where I upload all sorts of stuff like **games** I develop, **projects** I take part in, and even some recitations of the **Qur'an** I attempted with translations.
